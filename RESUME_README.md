- LinkedIn profile links
- Portfolio/website links
- All links remain functional in the PDF

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- reportlab>=4.0.0

## Usage Tips

1. **Edit the YAML file** with your information
2. **Run the generator** for best results
3. **Check the PDF** in a PDF viewer to verify links work
4. **Customize colors/fonts** in the Python script if needed
5. **Test with ATS systems** by uploading to job boards

The tool generates PDFs that are optimized for both visual appeal and ATS compatibility while maintaining all link functionality.
