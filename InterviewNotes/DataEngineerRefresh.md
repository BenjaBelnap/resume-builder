ðŸš€ Data Engineering Interview Refresh Kit

1. What Makes an ETL/Data Pipeline Scalable?

Scalability = ability to handle more data or users without breaking.
Key techniques:

Parallelization / Multithreading â†’ Break big jobs into smaller chunks processed simultaneously.

Distributed Processing â†’ Use frameworks (Spark, Flink, Hadoop) to spread work across multiple machines.

Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) â†’ Run jobs in isolated, easily reproducible environments; scale workers up/down as needed.

Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS) â†’ Decouple producers and consumers, allowing asynchronous and resilient processing.

Partitioning/Sharding â†’ Split large tables/files into smaller, parallelizable chunks (by time, ID, region, etc.).

Streaming vs Batch â†’ Stream when near-real-time data is needed; batch for heavy but less frequent workloads.


ðŸ’¡ Interview tip: Pick one or two techniques and give an example from your work. That grounds your answer in reality.

2. TRUNCATE vs DELETE

DELETE

Removes rows one by one (can use WHERE).

Logs each row removal (slower on big tables).

Can be rolled back (transaction-safe).

Triggers DELETE triggers.


TRUNCATE

Removes all rows (no WHERE).

Drops and resets table pages (much faster).

Resets identity/auto-increment counters.

Cannot be rolled back in some systems (depends on DB).

No triggers fired.



ðŸ’¡ Rule of thumb: Use DELETE for selective row removal; TRUNCATE for wiping a table clean.

3. SQL Query Execution Order

Even though you write SQL as SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... GROUP BY ... HAVING ... ORDER BY, the execution order is:

1. FROM / JOIN â†’ build dataset


2. WHERE â†’ filter rows


3. GROUP BY â†’ group rows


4. HAVING â†’ filter groups


5. SELECT â†’ choose columns/expressions


6. ORDER BY â†’ sort results


7. LIMIT â†’ final row restriction

4. HAVING vs WHERE

WHERE â†’ filters before grouping (on raw rows).

HAVING â†’ filters after grouping (on aggregates).


Example:

-- WHERE filters rows before grouping
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000
GROUP BY department;

-- HAVING filters groups after aggregation
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 70000;

5. Other Quick-Hit SQL Refreshers

Indexes â†’ speed up reads, slow down writes. Use on columns in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY.

Normalization vs Denormalization

Normalization = reduce redundancy, better writes.

Denormalization = faster reads, common in analytics.


Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), SUM() OVER(...)) â†’ used for advanced aggregations without collapsing rows.

ACID Properties â†’ Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.

6. Data Engineering Scaling Concepts

Batch vs Streaming

Batch = periodic, big chunks (nightly ETL).

Streaming = continuous, real-time (Kafka + Flink/Spark Streaming).


Idempotency â†’ re-running the same job doesnâ€™t break data (e.g., MERGE instead of duplicate inserts).

Orchestration â†’ tools like Airflow, Prefect, Dagster manage dependencies, retries, scheduling.

Cloud Scaling Patterns

Storage: partitioning (S3, Delta Lake).

Compute: autoscaling clusters (Databricks, EMR).
