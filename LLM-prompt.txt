Tailor my resume to the following job description. Keep lengths similar, I want to keep this all on one page. Do not add new sections to the yaml, this is compiled into a pdf and changing section structure breaks it. For reference, I have experience in Java, C#, Python, SQL Server, MySQL, Postgres, Powershell, Bash, IT service management, Agile, etc. If you are unsure if I have experience in something, ask before lying on the resume.
